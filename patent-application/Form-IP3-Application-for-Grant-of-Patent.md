## 5. ABSTRACT

A decentralized healthcare data sharing system that enables secure, privacy-preserving medical record exchange between hospitals using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and IPFS technology. The system comprises a patient-centric architecture where medical records are encrypted and stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) with cryptographic proofs that verify data authenticity without revealing patient information. The invention includes verifiable credential-based consent management, selective disclosure mechanisms, and emergency access protocols while maintaining complete patient privacy and enabling seamless cross-hospital medical record sharing.
