# DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

## TITLE
"MediBridge: A Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Healthcare Data Sharing System Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs and IPFS Technology"

## FIELD OF INVENTION
The present invention relates to healthcare information systems, specifically to secure, privacy-preserving medical record sharing between healthcare institutions using decentralized IPFS storage technology and zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs for cross-hospital interoperability.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Technical Problem
Traditional healthcare data sharing systems suffer from several critical limitations:

1. **Centralized Storage Vulnerabilities**: Medical records stored in centralized databases are vulnerable to single points of failure, data breaches, and unauthorized access.

2. **Privacy Concerns**: Current systems often expose sensitive patient information during verification processes, violating patient privacy rights.

3. **Interoperability Issues**: Different hospital systems use incompatible formats and protocols, making cross-institutional data sharing difficult and error-prone.

4. **Consent Management**: Existing consent mechanisms are often opaque, difficult to revoke, and lack cryptographic verification.

5. **Data Sovereignty**: Patients have limited control over their medical data and cannot easily manage who accesses their information.

### Prior Art Limitations
Existing solutions include:
- Centralized Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
- Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) with traditional encryption
- IPFS-based medical record systems without privacy-preserving verification
- Traditional consent management systems

These solutions fail to address the fundamental privacy and interoperability challenges in healthcare data sharing.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a comprehensive solution to healthcare data sharing challenges through a decentralized, privacy-preserving system that combines:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** for cryptographic verification without data exposure
2. **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** for decentralized, redundant storage
3. **Verifiable Credentials** for cryptographically enforced consent management
4. **Selective Disclosure** mechanisms for granular data access control
5. **Emergency Access Protocols** for critical care scenarios

### Key Technical Innovations

#### 1. Zero-Knowledge Medical Record Verification
The system generates cryptographic proofs that verify medical data authenticity without revealing the actual patient information. Using ZoKrates circuits and Poseidon hashing, the invention creates mathematical proofs that can be verified by any hospital while maintaining complete patient privacy.

#### 2. Triple Redundancy Storage Architecture
Medical records are stored with triple redundancy:
- **IPFS**: Immediate access with decentralized distribution
- **Filecoin**: Long-term archival storage with economic incentives
- **Local Hospital Node**: Fast access for frequent records

#### 3. Verifiable Credential-Based Consent
Patient consent is managed through cryptographically signed verifiable credentials that can be verified by any participating institution without revealing patient identity.

#### 4. Selective Disclosure Mechanisms
The system allows patients to control exactly which medical data fields are shared with specific hospitals, enabling granular privacy control.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### System Architecture

#### 1. Patient Identity Management
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Each patient receives a unique DID based on their phone number or email
- **Secure Key Vault**: Patient private keys are stored in encrypted vaults with hardware security module (HSM) protection
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Phone-based OTP and wallet-based signatures for identity verification

#### 2. Medical Record Submission (Hospital A)
```
Input: Patient medical data (diagnosis, prescription, treatment)
Process:
1. Encrypt data using AES-256-GCM
2. Generate Poseidon hash of medical data
3. Create ZoKrates circuit for ZKP generation
4. Store encrypted data on IPFS with triple redundancy
5. Generate cryptographic proofs for data authenticity
6. Issue verifiable credential for record access
Output: IPFS CID, Filecoin CID, ZKP verification codes
```

#### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation
The system uses ZoKrates circuits to generate proofs that verify:
- Medical record authenticity without revealing content
- Patient consent status without exposing identity
- Data integrity through cryptographic hashing
- Selective disclosure permissions

#### 4. Record Access and Verification (Hospital B)
```
Input: Patient phone number, consent credential
Process:
1. Search patient records by DID
2. Verify consent credential cryptographically
3. Retrieve encrypted data from IPFS
4. Decrypt using patient-controlled keys
5. Verify ZKP for data authenticity
6. Display medical information with audit trail
Output: Decrypted medical record with verification status
```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### 1. Zero-Knowledge Proof Circuit (ZoKrates)
```zokrates
import "hashes/poseidon/poseidon" as poseidon;

def main(field a, field b, field c, field d, field e, field f, field g) {
    // Recompute hash of medical record
    field computed_hash = poseidon([d, e, f]);
    
    // Verify record hash matches provided hash
    assert(computed_hash == a);
    
    // Verify property codes for medical conditions
    field computed_property = b == 0 ? 0 : (b == 1 ? (f != 0 ? 1 : 0) : 0);
    assert(computed_property == c);
    assert(c == g);
}
```
