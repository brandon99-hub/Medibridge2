🔐 1. Patient Identity and DID Handling
Checkpoint	Status
☐ On patient sign-up (e.g., via phone/email), a DID is generated (did:key or did:ethr)	
☐ The patient’s DID is securely stored and linked to their account	
☐ Private key is encrypted and stored (or derived from a secure source)	
☐ Patients do not see or manage keys manually unless they explicitly ask	

🧠 2. Consent Workflow Design
Checkpoint	Status
☐ Hospitals cannot access patient records by default	
☐ A request-for-consent workflow exists (e.g., Hospital B → Patient)	
☐ Patients are shown:	

What data will be shared

With whom (hospital name)

For how long

Why (e.g., treatment, second opinion)
☐ Patient approves/denies in a clear, accessible modal
☐ The system signs a Verifiable Credential (VC) or UCAN token with:

Patient DID

Hospital B DID

CID (IPFS hash of the record)

Time window (e.g., 24–72 hours)

Scope of access
☐ Consent actions (approve/revoke) are logged and timestamped

🔏 3. Cryptographic Authorization
Checkpoint	Status
☐ VC or UCAN is cryptographically signed with patient’s DID	
☐ Hospital B uses the signed credential to retrieve the record	
☐ Backend verifies the credential/token signature before allowing access	
☐ Expired or revoked credentials are rejected automatically	

📦 4. Data Storage & Access
Checkpoint	Status
☐ All patient records are encrypted before uploading to IPFS	
☐ Encryption key is:	

Stored securely

Only shared with authorized hospital on valid request
☐ IPFS content hash (CID) is used in the VC as a reference
☐ No raw health data is stored in centralized DB (only metadata + CIDs)
☐ Records can be decrypted only if hospital has VC + encryption key

🧾 5. Auditing & Logs
Checkpoint	Status
☐ All consent events are logged:	

Who requested

Who approved

Timestamp

Duration
☐ Audit log is available to:

Patients (what access they granted)

Admin (for compliance)
☐ Hospitals accessing data are logged with:

Timestamp

Record ID

Access outcome (granted/denied)

🌍 6. Patient-Centric UX
Checkpoint	Status
☐ Patient sees simple modals, not cryptographic terms	
☐ Can revoke consent at any time from their dashboard	
☐ Sees a list of:	

Active consents

Past access events

Hospitals they’ve authorized
☐ UI avoids wallet pop-ups unless explicitly enabled
☐ Optional: Export DID / keys for advanced users

🧪 7. Testing & Security Checks
Checkpoint	Status
☐ Tried to access a record without consent — rejected ✅	
☐ Tried with expired VC — rejected ✅	
☐ Tried with tampered VC — rejected ✅	
☐ Hospital A can only view records they submitted	
☐ Hospital B can only view records they were approved for
