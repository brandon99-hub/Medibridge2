## SPECIFICATION

### BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0001] The present invention is in the technical field of healthcare information technology. More particularly, the present invention is in the technical field of secure medical record sharing and interoperability systems. More particularly, the present invention is in the technical field of privacy-preserving medical data exchange between healthcare institutions using decentralized storage and cryptographic verification.

[0002] Conventional medical record sharing systems rely on centralized databases and traditional encryption methods that require patients to trust third-party intermediaries with their sensitive health information. These systems typically store medical records in centralized servers where they are vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access, and single points of failure. Additionally, existing systems lack granular patient consent control and do not provide cryptographic proof of data integrity without revealing the actual medical information. The difficulties of ensuring patient privacy while enabling necessary medical data sharing are compounded when multiple hospitals need to coordinate patient care, as current systems either require patients to manually transport physical records or rely on insecure electronic transmission methods that expose sensitive medical data to potential interception and misuse.

### SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0003] The present invention is a decentralized medical record interoperability system that enables secure, privacy-preserving sharing of patient medical records between healthcare institutions using a combination of decentralized storage, zero-knowledge proofs, and verifiable credentials.

[0004] The system comprises a first hospital interface for submitting encrypted medical records to decentralized storage networks, a zero-knowledge proof generation system for creating cryptographic proofs of medical conditions without revealing sensitive data, a verifiable credential management system for patient-controlled consent, and a second hospital interface for accessing medical records through cryptographic verification. The system utilizes IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage with triple redundancy, Filecoin for long-term archival, and local hospital nodes for fast access, ensuring high availability and data integrity while maintaining complete patient privacy through cryptographic consent mechanisms.

### DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0013] Referring now to the invention in more detail, in Fig. 1 there is shown a medical record interoperability system 10 having a first hospital interface 12 for submitting medical records, a decentralized storage network 14 for storing encrypted medical data, a zero-knowledge proof system 16 for generating privacy-preserving proofs, a verifiable credential system 18 for managing patient consent, and a second hospital interface 20 for accessing medical records through cryptographic verification. The system 10 further comprises a patient identity management system 22 for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a triple redundancy storage system 24 for ensuring high availability, and an emergency access system 26 for time-limited medical record access.

[0014] In more detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 1, the first hospital interface 12 is configured to receive medical record data including patient information, diagnosis, prescription, treatment details, and physician notes. The interface 12 encrypts this data using AES-256-GCM encryption with patient-specific keys before transmitting it to the decentralized storage network 14. The decentralized storage network 14 utilizes IPFS for immediate access, Filecoin for long-term archival, and local hospital nodes for fast retrieval, creating a triple redundancy architecture that ensures 99.9% availability even if one or more storage layers fail.

[0015] The construction details of the invention as shown in Fig. 1 are that the system 10 may be implemented using web technologies such as React for the user interfaces, Node.js for the backend services, and PostgreSQL for metadata storage. The cryptographic components utilize industry-standard libraries including circomlibjs for zero-knowledge proofs, did-jwt for verifiable credentials, and crypto-js for encryption operations. The IPFS integration is achieved through Pinata SDK for reliable decentralized storage, while Filecoin integration provides long-term archival with cryptographic proofs of storage.

[0016] Referring now to the invention shown in Fig. 2, there is shown a medical record submission process 30 having a data input step 32, an encryption step 34, a decentralized storage step 36, and a confirmation step 38. The data input step 32 receives medical record information from Hospital A including patient name, national ID, visit date, diagnosis, prescription, and physician details. The encryption step 34 applies AES-256-GCM encryption to the medical data using a patient-specific encryption key derived through PBKDF2-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations and patient-specific salt. The decentralized storage step 36 stores the encrypted data on IPFS with redundancy across multiple nodes, simultaneously archives the data on Filecoin for long-term storage, and maintains a local copy on the hospital's secure server. The confirmation step 38 provides Hospital A with storage confirmations including IPFS content identifiers (CIDs), Filecoin deal IDs, and verification codes for accessing the stored records.

[0017] In more detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 2, the medical record submission process 30 generates a unique patient DID using the did:key format if the patient does not already have one, links the medical record to the patient's DID for future access control, and creates metadata records that include storage locations, encryption methods, and access permissions without storing any sensitive medical information in the centralized database.

[0018] Referring now to the invention shown in Fig. 3, there is shown a zero-knowledge proof system 40 having a proof generation step 42, a cryptographic verification step 44, and a selective disclosure step 46. The proof generation step 42 creates cryptographic proofs that verify the existence and properties of medical records without revealing the actual medical data. The system utilizes ZoKrates circuits to generate proofs that demonstrate, for example, that a patient has a valid medical condition requiring treatment, or that a patient requires rest, without exposing the specific diagnosis or treatment details. The cryptographic verification step 44 validates these proofs using public verification keys, ensuring that the proofs are mathematically sound and have not been tampered with. The selective disclosure step 46 allows patients to control which specific medical information is revealed to requesting hospitals, enabling granular consent management at the record level.

[0019] In more detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 3, the zero-knowledge proof system 40 uses Poseidon hash functions to create commitments to medical data, generates Groth16 proofs that demonstrate knowledge of the underlying data without revealing it, and provides verification codes that can be shared with hospitals for proof validation. The system supports multiple proof types including condition proofs, age verification proofs, allergy proofs, and medication requirement proofs, each designed to provide specific medical information while maintaining patient privacy.

[0020] Referring now to the invention shown in Fig. 4, there is shown a verifiable credential system 50 having a consent request step 52, a patient approval step 54, a credential issuance step 56, and a credential verification step 58. The consent request step 52 allows Hospital B to request access to specific medical records by submitting a request that includes the hospital's DID, the requested record identifiers, and the purpose of access. The patient approval step 54 presents the consent request to the patient through a secure interface, showing what data will be shared, with which hospital, for how long, and for what purpose. The credential issuance step 56 creates a cryptographically signed verifiable credential when the patient approves the request, containing the patient's DID as issuer, the hospital's DID as subject, the specific record CIDs, and time-limited access permissions. The credential verification step 58 validates the verifiable credential when Hospital B attempts to access the medical records, checking the cryptographic signature, expiration time, and revocation status before granting access.

[0021] In more detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 4, the verifiable credential system 50 uses JWT (JSON Web Token) format for credentials, signs them with the patient's private key using ES256K algorithm, and includes additional authenticated data (AAD) for integrity verification. The system supports granular consent control where each credential can be issued for specific records, categories of records, or time-limited access periods, and patients can revoke credentials at any time, immediately invalidating access permissions.

[0022] Referring now to the invention shown in Fig. 5, there is shown a medical record access process 60 having a credential submission step 62, a verification step 64, a decryption step 66, and a record display step 68. The credential submission step 62 allows Hospital B to submit a verifiable credential to the system backend for verification. The verification step 64 validates the credential's cryptographic signature, checks expiration and revocation status, and verifies that the hospital is authorized to access the requested records. The decryption step 66 retrieves the encrypted medical records from IPFS using the content identifiers in the credential, decrypts them using the patient's encryption key, and prepares them for display. The record display step 68 presents the decrypted medical records to Hospital B in a secure interface, logging all access attempts for audit purposes.

[0023] In more detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 5, the medical record access process 60 implements failover mechanisms that attempt to retrieve records from IPFS first, then Filecoin if IPFS is unavailable, and finally from local hospital storage if both decentralized networks fail. The system maintains comprehensive audit logs of all access attempts, including the requesting hospital, accessed records, access timestamps, and verification results, ensuring full compliance with healthcare privacy regulations.

[0024] Referring now to the invention shown in Fig. 6, there is shown a triple redundancy storage system 70 having an IPFS storage layer 72, a Filecoin archival layer 74, and a local backup layer 76. The IPFS storage layer 72 provides immediate access to medical records through distributed hash tables and content-addressed storage, with automatic redundancy across multiple IPFS nodes. The Filecoin archival layer 74 provides long-term storage with cryptographic proofs of storage, ensuring that medical records remain available even if IPFS nodes go offline. The local backup layer 76 maintains encrypted copies of medical records on secure hospital servers for emergency access when decentralized networks are unavailable.

[0025] In more detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 6, the triple redundancy storage system 70 monitors the health and availability of each storage layer in real-time, automatically routes requests to the most available storage layer, and provides storage cost optimization by using IPFS for frequently accessed records and Filecoin for long-term archival. The system calculates redundancy levels based on successful storage across multiple layers and provides detailed storage metrics including response times, availability percentages, and cost analysis.

[0026] Referring now to the invention shown in Fig. 7, there is shown a patient identity management system 80 having a DID generation step 82, a key management step 84, and an identity verification step 86. The DID generation step 82 creates unique decentralized identifiers for patients using the did:key format, which are cryptographically verifiable and do not require a central authority. The key management step 84 securely stores patient private keys using AES-256-GCM encryption with patient-specific salt and PBKDF2 key derivation, allowing patients to export their keys via QR codes or recovery phrases for backup purposes. The identity verification step 86 verifies patient identity through multiple methods including phone number verification, email verification, and wallet signature verification for advanced users.

[0027] In more detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 7, the patient identity management system 80 supports both traditional authentication methods for patients who prefer simplicity and advanced Web3 authentication for patients who want full control over their cryptographic keys. The system automatically syncs patient identities across different authentication methods and provides secure key recovery mechanisms that do not compromise the security of patient data.

[0028] Referring now to the invention shown in Fig. 8, there is shown an emergency access system 90 having an emergency request step 92, a rapid verification step 94, a time-limited access step 96, and an automatic revocation step 98. The emergency request step 92 allows healthcare providers to request emergency access to medical records when immediate care is required, bypassing normal consent procedures. The rapid verification step 94 performs expedited verification of the emergency request using pre-approved emergency protocols and physician credentials. The time-limited access step 96 grants temporary access to medical records for a limited duration, typically 24-72 hours, with automatic expiration. The automatic revocation step 98 immediately revokes access permissions when the emergency period expires, ensuring that emergency access does not become permanent.

[0029] In more detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 8, the emergency access system 90 requires dual authorization from primary and secondary physicians, logs all emergency access attempts with detailed metadata, and provides patients with immediate notification when their records are accessed under emergency protocols. The system maintains separate audit trails for emergency access and provides detailed reporting for compliance and quality assurance purposes.

[0030] The advantages of the present invention include, without limitation, that it provides complete patient privacy through zero-knowledge proofs that verify medical conditions without revealing sensitive data, enables granular consent control where patients can grant access to specific records for specific time periods, ensures high availability through triple redundancy storage across IPFS, Filecoin, and local networks, maintains cryptographic integrity of medical records through verifiable credentials and digital signatures, supports emergency access protocols for urgent medical situations, provides comprehensive audit trails for compliance with healthcare regulations, and eliminates single points of failure through decentralized architecture while maintaining the security and privacy standards required for healthcare data.

[0031] In broad embodiment, the present invention is a decentralized medical record interoperability system that enables secure, privacy-preserving sharing of patient medical records between healthcare institutions using cryptographic verification, zero-knowledge proofs, and verifiable credentials without requiring patients to trust centralized intermediaries with their sensitive health information.

[0032] While the foregoing written description of the invention enables one of ordinary skill to make and use what is considered presently to be the best mode thereof, those of ordinary skill will understand and appreciate the existence of variations, combinations, and equivalents of the specific embodiment, method, and examples herein. The invention should therefore not be limited by the above described embodiment, method, and examples, but by all embodiments and methods within the scope and spirit of the invention as claimed.
